# AGENTS.md

Open-Inspect is a single-tenant background coding agent system that spawns sandboxed development
environments for connection-pinned GitHub and self-hosted Gitea repositories. Stack: Cloudflare
Workers (TypeScript), provider-neutral sandbox runtime (Python), Next.js (React), Terraform.

## Architecture

Three logical tiers. Live session data uses WebSockets; bot and API entry points use signed HTTP:

1. **Web Client** (Next.js on Vercel or Cloudflare Workers via OpenNext) — UI with configured
   sign-in providers, session dashboard, real-time streaming
2. **Control Plane** (Cloudflare Workers + Durable Objects) — session lifecycle, WebSocket hub,
   authentication, and SCM connections. Each session is a Durable Object with SQLite storage. Uses
   D1 for the session index, repo metadata, environments, and encrypted secrets.
3. **Data Plane** (Modal, Daytona, Vercel, OpenComputer, managed E2B, or self-hosted Cube; Python
   runtime) — isolated environments running a session-pinned OpenCode, Codex, Claude Code, or
   DeepSeek harness. The provider-neutral bridge normalizes harness events. On Cube, the supervisor
   owns one loopback-only AIO Chromium/CDP/Browser-MCP runtime shared by MCP and agent-browser.

**Bot integrations** — all Cloudflare Workers using Hono:

- `slack-bot` — Slack messages → coding sessions
- `github-bot` — PR review assignments and @mention commands
- `linear-bot` — Linear agent webhooks → coding sessions
- `feishu-bot` — Feishu messages/cards → GitHub or Gitea coding sessions; completion media delivery

**Prompt flow**: client/bot → control plane DO → sandbox bridge → selected harness → normalized
events back through the same Durable Object and client channel.

**Visual flow on Cube**: harness → `aio_browser` MCP or agent-browser → shared Chromium → screenshot
file → `upload_media` → control-plane object storage → Web/Feishu. Live application ports use a
separate provider tunnel or trusted preview gateway; CDP `9222` and Browser MCP `8100` stay private.

### Package Dependency Graph

```
@open-inspect/shared  ←  control-plane, web, slack-bot, feishu-bot, github-bot, linear-bot
```

**Build `@open-inspect/shared` first** whenever you change shared types. Other packages import from
it at build time.

## Testing

All TypeScript packages use **Vitest**; Python uses **pytest** + pytest-asyncio.

### Test file locations

- **control-plane unit**: co-located as `src/**/*.test.ts` — run in Node environment
- **control-plane integration**: separate `test/integration/*.test.ts` — run in workerd via
  `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` with real D1 bindings
- **web, slack-bot, linear-bot**: co-located `src/**/*.test.ts`
- **github-bot**: separate `test/*.test.ts`
- **modal-infra**: `tests/test_*.py`
- **sandbox-runtime**: `tests/test_*.py`

### Control-plane integration tests

These run inside a real `workerd` runtime with Miniflare, using the `cloudflareTest()` plugin from
`@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`. Important:

- Integration tests share one D1 instance — use `cleanD1Tables()` or equivalent cleanup in
  `beforeEach`/`afterEach` to avoid cross-test pollution
- D1 migrations from `terraform/d1/migrations/` are applied automatically via
  `test/integration/apply-migrations.ts`
- Helpers in `test/integration/helpers.ts`: `initSession()`, `queryDO()`, `seedEvents()`

## Coding Conventions

### Durations and timeouts

- **Use seconds for Python, milliseconds for TypeScript.** These match each ecosystem's conventions
  (Modal `timeout=` takes seconds; control-plane uses `_MS` suffixes throughout).
- **Encode the unit in the name.** Python: `timeout_seconds`. TypeScript: `timeoutMs`,
  `INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT_MS`. Never use a bare `timeout`.
- **Define each default value exactly once.** Extract to a named constant and import everywhere.
- **Don't restate literal values in comments.** Write `Defaults to DEFAULT_SANDBOX_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`,
  not `Default: 7200`.

### Extending existing patterns

- When threading an existing field through new code paths, evaluate whether the existing design
  (naming, types, units) is correct — don't blindly propagate it. Fix bad names or units in the same
  change rather than spreading the problem.

### Commit messages

Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`, `test:`. Keep the subject
under 72 characters. Use the PR body for details, not the commit message.

## Key Gotchas

- **Build order**: always build `@open-inspect/shared` before packages that depend on it.
- **PKCS#8 keys**: Cloudflare Workers require PKCS#8 format for GitHub App private keys — convert
  with `openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform PEM -nocrypt`.
- **Durable Object bindings**: new DO bindings require a two-phase Terraform deploy — first with
  `enable_durable_object_bindings = false`, then `true`.
- **No `wrangler.toml`**: control-plane config is generated by Terraform, not checked in.
- **Modal deployment**: from `packages/modal-infra`, run
  `uv run python deploy.py --build-sandbox-image` before `uv run modal deploy deploy.py` (or
  `uv run modal deploy -m src`). Never deploy `src/app.py` directly; it doesn't import function
  modules.
- **Modal image rebuild**: update `CACHE_BUSTER` in `src/images/base.py` to force a rebuild.
- **Cube template rebuild**: run `packages/e2b-infra/build-cube-template.sh` with a unique
  `CUBE_IMAGE_BUILD_LABEL`, wait for `READY`, then change `E2B_TEMPLATE_ID`. Existing sandboxes keep
  their original template.
- **AIO browser boundary**: Cube is the VM/isolation base. Only Chromium and
  `@agent-infra/mcp-server-browser` are copied from the pinned AIO image. Never expose CDP `9222` or
  Browser MCP `8100`; screenshots leave through `upload_media`.
- **Repo-less tunnel caveat**: preview URLs remain in control-plane session state, but repo-less
  sessions currently may not materialize `/workspace/.tunnels.env`.
- **Web platform choice**: set `web_platform = "cloudflare"` in Terraform variables to deploy the
  web app to Cloudflare Workers via OpenNext instead of Vercel. When using Cloudflare, Vercel
  credentials are not required (dummy defaults are used). `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL` must be available at
  build time since Next.js inlines `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars into the client bundle.
- **Repo owners can be nested namespaces**: a `repo_owner` is not always a single segment. GitHub
  owners are (`octocat`), but GitLab subgroups nest (`group/subgroup`), so an owner may contain `/`.
  Only `repo_name` is a single path segment (it's the checkout directory under `/workspace`); the
  owner remains part of the repository identity in clone URLs, API routes, manifests, and storage
  keys. Don't validate or split owners as single segments. Use the shared repository identity
  helpers in TypeScript; where a full `owner/name` string is unavoidable, split on the **last** `/`
  and encode the owner as one API route segment. `repo_config.parse_repositories` accepts `/`-joined
  owners (see `is_safe_repo_owner`).

## CI/CD

Pushing to `main` auto-deploys changed services:

- **Terraform** → control plane + D1 migrations + web app if `web_platform = "cloudflare"`
  (triggers: `terraform/`, `packages/*/`)
- **Vercel** → web app when `web_platform = "vercel"` (triggers: `packages/web/`,
  `packages/shared/`)
- **Modal** → data plane (triggers: `packages/modal-infra/`, deployed via Terraform apply)

CI runs lint, typecheck, and tests for all TypeScript and Python packages on every push and PR.
